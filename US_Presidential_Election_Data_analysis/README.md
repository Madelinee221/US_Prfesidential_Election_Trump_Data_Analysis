# US_Presidential_Election_Data_Analysis

## Overview

This paper analyzes Donald Trump’s polling performance using data from high-quality pollsters with ratings of 2.7 or higher. It examines key variables such as Trump’s polling percentage, pollster reliability, and whether polls are national or state-specific. By employing histograms and box plots, the study visualizes the distribution and variability of Trump’s support across different pollsters. The analysis draws on concepts from Blumenthal (2014) and Pasek (2015) to explore how pollster credibility and aggregation impact political forecasting. The findings provide insights into polling accuracy and the factors influencing Trump’s reported levels of support across diverse polls.
